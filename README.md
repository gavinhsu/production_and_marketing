# production_and_marketing

 This is the final project of the course of production and marketing information system.
 
 We choose <b>"Small Apartment"</b>, a pet-friendly restaurant near the NCCU, as the business case of the final project.<br>
 We focus on helping them build an information system for production and marketing.<br>
 
 <b>In the marketing system part,</b> we use many marketing indicators and customer group analysis techniques.<br>
 <b>In the operation management system,</b> we also use many sales forecasting indicators and inventory management analysis techniques.<br>
 
 Our goal is to help this store integrate its production and marketing process through web technology, combined with background knowledge of production and marketing.
